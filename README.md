# Week 5 - Joining & Reshaping Datasets

Oftentimes, the data that we work with is not contained in a single table, but multiple. In cases like this, we must "join" data together. Further, data is frequently in the wrong "shape" for analysis - sometimes it must be "wide" and sometimes it must be "long". The tidyverse provides tools to more easily shape data to support analysis. Topics covered will include:

-   Understanding types of joins - right, left, inner, etc. 
-   Identifying "tidy" data Reshaping data using `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` 
-   Using tidy data to create more complex data visualizations with `ggplot2`
